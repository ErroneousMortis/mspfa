<p> hi, i want to give big, big thank you for the 120+ favorites on this adventure!</p>
<p>i really did NOT expect to get so much positive feedback on this when it started, or that it would get so many favorites even though it had less than 20 pages and was barely advertised it at all. it made me feel really motivated to keep improving my art and storytelling skills over the past 2 or so years now. hopefully i can keep doing that and working on this story little by little!</p>
<p>i’ll remove this page come next update so the flow of the comic won’t be broken. anyway, peace out and I hope you’ll enjoy reading further!! <3 </p>
